# GradientDescent_of-Linear-Regression-Classification-Matlab-
THis routine is based on Matlab 
## Requirements:
Matlab2012b and its latest version
## Description:
This routine using GradientDescent to do the Linear Regression and Classification. I set two questions as an example:
* We think the height of human has a close relationship with the weight of human, Now we get 15 american women's (Age:30-39)heights and weights, We assume the predict function is y=b1+a1*x+a1*x^2 (x is height and y is weight). So we can get the optimum predict function between than.
* Based on the length & width of the sepal and length and width of the petal, predict what kind of Iris it is (Two kinds: setosa & versicolor), the dataset is come from 'UCI Machine Learning Repository URL:http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris'
